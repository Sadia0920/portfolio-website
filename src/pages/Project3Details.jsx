          Hi, I'm Sadia Afrin, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in building scalable and efficient web applications.
          <br></br>
          I thrive on solving complex problems and turning creative ideas into reality. Whether it's crafting responsive designs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or building robust server-side solutions with Node.js and MongoDB, I enjoy every step of the development process.
          <br></br>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or refining my skills through online learning and challenges. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to grow and collaborate with other developers to create impactful solutions.
          <br></br>
          Let's build something amazing together!
